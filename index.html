# Welcome to the Void.
We hope you have a good time.



The void is a place that indeed exists. 
It's a place to talk about really anything, as long as it doesn't break any rules. 
At some points we'll host events and other fun stuff.
We want to be nice to everyone and just have an overall good time. 
If there are any problems ping me or any of the mods, as long as they are online.
