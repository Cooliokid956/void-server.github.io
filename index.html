# Welcome to the Void. <br>
We hope you have a good time. <br>



The void is a place that indeed exists. <br>
It's a place to talk about really anything, as long as it doesn't break any rules. <br>
At some points we'll host events and other fun stuff.<br>
We want to be nice to everyone and just have an overall good time. <br>
If there are any problems ping me or any of the mods, as long as they are online.<br>


# Meet the mods<br>
- Fur!Shadow#7004<br>









# Server Bulletin Board<br>

- Nothing much yet<br>
- Redesign once I get help from Laki



` Thanks, and we hope you have a good time. `<br>
